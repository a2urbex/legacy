**a2urbex** was born from a common passion between [@clementp0]([github.com](https://github.com/clementp0)) and [@LahaxeHugo]([github.com](https://github.com/LahaxeHugo)). We have been doing urbex (*urban exploration*) for 4 years now and we needed a simple solution to centralize locations, with comments, status, categories, filters, and more... 

That's how a2urbex.eu was born. A simple and clean platform in Symfony with EasyAdmin.

**Later on we added features such as :** 

- Favourite lists 
- User management 
- Image generation by AI 
- Import of KMZ / KML files  
- Direct Waze / Map links 
- A Pinterest scraper 
- Online user management 
- Progressive Web App 
- And much much more... 

We continue to add features very (*very*) regularly...
